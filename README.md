Hello,  :octocat:  

My name is Nzungize Lambert, Omics Data Science Practitioner and Machine Learning Enthusiast works in Linux, R and Python. 
I am broadly interested in NGS data analysis and Computational biology to drive disease mechanisms, biomarkers identification, 
and therapeutic targets for drug development.I'd be happy to collaborate on ML/DL based projects in omics data.


- I write about Bioinformatics and Machine Learning ideas on Twitter [ @nzulapa](https://twitter.com/nzulapa), Synbio Rwanda [blog](https://www.synbiorwanda.com/page-zlwLrU) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nzungize-lambert-7b1a57127/).

- I wrote a Book: _Mastering RNA Seq Data Analysis in Infectious Diseases: Practices: (Malaria and COVID-19)_.
The entire eBook is available on [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DXGYFHR).

## Projects
   * Dual RNA-seq profiles of Malaria Vectors and Bacteria, NIH/ASBCB Omics Codeathon.
   * Young Scientists from the Global South of the Biosecurity Diplomacy, United Nations.
   * Infectious Diseases Genomics Workshop (RNA seq data analysis in Linux), ISCB Africa.
