Hello, 

My name is Nzungize Lambert, Biomedical Omics Data Science Practitioner, and Machine Learning Enthusiast works in R and Python. 
I am broadly interested in NGS data analysis and Computational biology to drive disease mechanisms, biomarkers identification, 
and therapeutic targets for drug development.


- I write about Synthetic Biology, Bioinformatics and Machine Learning ideas on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nzulapa) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nzungize-lambert-7b1a57127/).

- I wrote a Book: _Mastering RNA Seq Data Analysis in Infectious Diseases: Practices: (Malaria and COVID-19)_.
The entire eBook is available on [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DXGYFHR) or for free through [email](nzulapa@outlook.com) request.
